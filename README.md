This is project is an implementation of the Royal Game Of Ur the oldest known board game dating back to mesopotamia 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Game_of_Ur. This was accomplished with the unity engine and c# scripts to manipulate the game objects. This project was created mainly to learn how to use the Unity Engine.

The goal of Ur is to get all the player pieces to the end of the board.
Once each player succesufully removes all 6 of there pieces from play they win.

If a piece lands on an enemy square the enemy piece is captured. Each players side are their own saftey squares. The center row contains the combat squares, where captures can take place.

Rolls are determined with 4 marked tetrahedrons. When a marked edge lands on top it is counted in summed to the total allowed movement. From 0-4.

Controls:

Arrow Keys control camera.
Click on piece to move it after roll.
W and D Keys Zoom in and out.
